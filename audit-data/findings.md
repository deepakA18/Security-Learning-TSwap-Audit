### [I-1] `PoolFactory::PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist` is not used and should be removed

```diff
-     error PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist(address tokenAddress);  
```

### [I-2] Lacking zero address check

```diff
 constructor(address wethToken) {
+       if(wethToken == address(0))
        {
            revert();
        }
        i_wethToken = wethToken;
    }
```


### [I-3] `PoolFactory::createPool` should use `.symbol()` instead of `.name()` 

```diff

- string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat("ts", IERC20(tokenAddress).name());

+ string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat("ts", IERC20(tokenAddress).symbol());


```

### [I-4]  Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
